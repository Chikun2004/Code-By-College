    <p style="background-color: Violet;">Among the early inventors of computers, Lady Ada
        Lovelace was perhaps one of the most remarkable one. She is often credited to be the
        ﬁrst ever programmer. Additionally, she was the ﬁrst one to use an algorithm.</p>
        <h3 style="color: orange;">History of Computers</h3>
        <p style="color: slateblue;">Charles Babbage invented the ﬁrst mechanical computer.
            Perhaps, this is why he got the title of “Father of Computers”. Modern computers
            are based on his analytical machine.</p>
